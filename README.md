## About

<table>
<tr>
<td>

The Editing AIO is an open-source project currently being developed by AMEXif. It is free to download on payhip, but you can spend a teeny bit to support me, it is greatly appreciated!
EAIO was made with C# using the .NET Framework 4.7.2 and WPF. 
  
The UI is very much just a copy of Payload's original design. - https://youtu.be/PzP8mw7JUzI
<br>
Interpolation and Upscaling in V1.0 are mainly possible thanks to nihui! - https://github.com/nihui
<br>
Conversion is done using FFmpeg. - https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg

### Built With

- [C# .NET Framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/net472)
- [WPF](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/desktop/wpf/getting-started/?view=netframeworkdesktop-4.8)

## Getting Started

Download the package file from my payhip, it's 100% free, but I won't get mad if you decide to donate a teeny bit of your money ðŸ’¯

- [Download](https://payhip.com/b/InD9Z)

You can just download the installer which will install the newest version of eaio available into %localappdata%\EAIO
Or you can install the app files themselves into any folder you like using this approach!

Extract the .rar archive onto your desktop (or wherever you want really, I don't care).

Make a desktop shortcut pointing to the exe file found in the created directory.

**Now you can just run the shortcut and you're done! ðŸŽ‰**
