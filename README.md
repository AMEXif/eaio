## About

<table>
<tr>
<td>

The Editing AIO is an open-source project currently being developed by AMEXif. It is free to download on payhip, but you can spend a teeny bit to support me, it is greatly appreciated!
EAIO was made with C# using the .NET Framework 4.7.2 and WPF. 
  
The UI is very much just a copy of Payload's original design. - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOoKt2u-bE1NuELXSFaEdUw/featured
Interpolation and Upscaling in V1.0 are mainly possible thanks to nuhui! - https://github.com/nihui
<br>
Conversion is done using FFmpeg. - https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg

### Built With

- [C# .NET Framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/net472)
- [WPF](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/desktop/wpf/getting-started/?view=netframeworkdesktop-4.8)

## Getting Started

Download the package file from my payhip, it's 100% free, but I won't get mad if you decide to donate a teeny bit of your money ðŸ’¯

- [Download](https://payhip.com/b/InD9Z)

Extract the .rar archive onto your desktop (or wherever you want really, I don't care).

Make a desktop shortcut pointing to the exe file found in the created directory.

**Now you can just run the shortcut and you're done! ðŸŽ‰**

## Usage - Conversion

To convert a video super fast, select the "Transcoder" tab on the left panel.

Then select your input and output files by clicking on the three-dotted buttons next to the text blocks accordingly.

**After that, just click "Convert" and watch it go! ðŸŽ‰**

## Usage - Interpolation / Upscaling

To start the interpolation process, select the "Interpolation" tab.

Select if you want to delete any duplicate frames from the input video. This is important, as if you don't select this option the output video will most likely be very choppy! However, if you have already cut out any dead frames from the input video yourself, you can leave this unchecked.

**After this, the process of processing the video is pretty much the same as when converting. So you can just follow the guide at the top! ðŸŽ‰**
